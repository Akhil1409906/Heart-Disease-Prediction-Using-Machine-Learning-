# Heart Disease Prediction Using AdaBoost and Flask

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using the **AdaBoost Machine Learning Algorithm**. The system is built using **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, integrating machine learning to provide accurate predictions based on input medical data.

---

## Features

- Predict heart disease risk using patient data.
- User-friendly interface created with **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Machine learning backend powered by **AdaBoost** algorithm.
- Lightweight and fast API using **Flask**.
- Scalable and easy-to-deploy solution.

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For designing and styling the interface.

### Backend

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing logic.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework for building the web application.

### Machine Learning

- **AdaBoost Algorithm**: A powerful ensemble learning algorithm for heart disease prediction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing and training the ML model.

---

## Workflow

1. User inputs medical parameters (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) into the web form.
2. The data is sent to the backend through the Flask API.
3. The trained **AdaBoost model** processes the input and predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
4. The prediction result is displayed on the web page.
